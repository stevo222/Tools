    Script's Name: FuelItemPickup.cs
    Author: Keali'i Transfield

    Script's Description: This script is for a coin pickup object. 
        This script waits for a "Vehicle" tagged object to enter 
        and trigger this object's trigger collider. It then calls
        the static level manager and activates its "AddCoin" method.
        
    Script's Methods:
        - OnTriggerEnter2D

    // and this triggers this object's trigger collider.
    // In this case, this object checks that the object
    // is a vehicle, and acts accordingly (adding coin
    // score and disabling itself).
